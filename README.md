## Important Notes
1. **Photosensitivity Warning**  
   This project may contain flashing lights that could trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.

2. **Prevent Sleep Mode**  
   Ensure your system settings are configured to prevent the screen from turning off or entering sleep mode.

3. **Sound Feature**  
   Sound functionality is planned for a future update.

4. **Reducing Screen Flicker**  
   If the screen flicker is less intense, it is likely related to the FPS (frames per second) settings. Adjusting FPS may help.
